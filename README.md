# TEAM VISION ✌
## Developing a user-friendly web application for Multiple Disease Prediction
### Within this undertaking, we are utilizing machine learning techniques to forecast illnesses such as Pneumonia, Cardiovascular disease, and Malaria. These predictions are drawn from X-ray images, CSV datasets, and Blood smear samples, employing various machine learning models such as:
- CNN
- SVM
- Random Forest
- Stochastic Gradient Boosting
- XG Boost
- Resnet
- Logistic Regression
